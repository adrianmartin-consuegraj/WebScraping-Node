# Easy Web Scraping using Node
Different options to web scrape a website using Node.

I did web scraping to 'https://mikrotik.com/products' so I got the name of every product they are selling. 
The other node file is for web scraping a random wikipedia article, also getting a screenshot from that article.

## how to run this?
Choose between GettingProducts.js and RandomWikipediaArticle.js and run it through the Terminal with node, e.g.:

    node GettingProducts.js
